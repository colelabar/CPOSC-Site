            <p class="lora16">This ticket is the answer to everything. It grans you access to the vendor hall, all talks and presentations, and let's you grow some courage and submit a lightning talk! Plus, this gets you a fully functional t-shirt, another tote bag that you probably don't need which happens to be full of some cool conference swag, and it gets you access to breakfast elevensies, lunch, afternoon tea, and the oh-so-happening CPOSC afterparty. All that goodness and it's only $42.</p>

            <h5 class="mont21">$0</h5>
            <p class="lora16">We believe that information and access to it should be open, free and shared. The Open Access ticket program is an embodiment of that notion. Open Access tickets get you the same exact conference experience as the "Answer to Everything" ticket, but you get it all for absolutely no cost. These tickets operate like a "take-a-number" line at the deli counter. Any attendee is welcomed to request an Open Access ticket for any reason, no questions asked. Upon making your request, if there have been Open Access donations by other conference attendees, you will receive a ticket at no cost! If there are no funds in the donor pool, then you will wait until a donation is made. If not enough donations come in, prior to the conference, you will be given an opportunity to purchase at the door.</p>

            <p class="lora16">If you happen to believe that access to information (and especially Open Sourced information!) should be free, then here is your chance to help us enable that to happen at this very conference. For every donation of $42, or more to CPOSC, we'll grant access to a person who couldn't otherwise attend. These donations make it possible to offer Open Access ticket initiative, as well as our free and discounted student ticket programs.</p>

With an ever growing number of high-school students getting into programming, we are happy to welcome and encourage a small number of HS-aged students to attend the 9th annual CPOSC! By welcoming aspiring programmers, we hope that this conference will allow them to get a taste for what a professional future in the open source technology sector might be like.</p>
            <p class="lora16">Parents and students, please note: This is a professional conference featuring highly technical talks being presented by individuals with skilled and diverse technical backgrounds. The content is not expected to be offered at a "high school level" and attendees are encouraged to have an active interest in the field of computer science or hardware as to be better equipped for the experience. </p>
