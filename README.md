# CPOSC-Site

## Purpose
This assignment, from my 1st Semester at Thaddeus Stevens, was given to us after we learned a small bit of JavaScript. We were tasked with creating a site using wireframes given by our instructor, incorporating HTML, CSS, SASS, and JS into it. The site included a navigation tool, a Google Maps embed, and several JS bits to display our proficiency.
